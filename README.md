# Tic-Tac-Toe--Java

This repo contains the files for a simple one-player Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in Java. It is the front-end code for a larger project
that comprised my "Capstone" project in Software Engineering Technology at Cincinnati State Technical College. That project involved
programming a robotic-arm to move the game pieces on the Tic-Tac-Toe board in response to a player's chosen moves and the computer's
chosen counter-moves. All games (and game moves) were recorded in a Sql Server database which allowed for any previous game to be
replayed and re-enacted by the robotic-arm. The original project was coded in Visual Basic and has been adapted here for Java and
more limited functionality.
