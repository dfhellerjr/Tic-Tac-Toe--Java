# Tic-Tac-Toe--Java

This repo contains the files for a simple one-player Tic-Tac-Toe game coded in Java. It is the front-end code for a larger project
that comprised my "Capstone" project in Software Engineering Technology at Cincinnati State Technical College. That project involved
programming a robotic-arm to move the game pieces on the Tic-Tac-Toe board in response to a player's chosen moves and the computer's
chosen counter-moves. All games (and game moves) were recorded in a Sql Server database which allowed for any previous game to be
replayed and re-enacted by the robotic-arm. The original project was coded in Visual Basic and has been adapted here for Java and
more limited functionality.

The player choses both the skill-level and whether he/she makes the first move. As the skill-level increases the computer becomes 
increasingly difficult to beat. At the "expert" level it won't ever lose. Move logic was coded using heuristic methods as opposed
to a more efficient "min-max" algorythm but it works sufficiently well. 

The Java program code utilizes a "spring" layout format for the form (game board) and OOP (classes) for it's implementation. There
is an extensive collection of classes included here, many of which were not utilized but which would be extremely useful in other
projects. Many thanks to my friend, mentor & teaching professor James Patrick ("Pat") Callahan for developing most of this material.

This application was developed using the Eclipse Luna IDE v2.0.103 and Java JRE8
